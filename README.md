# Aaron's Product Search Demo!
Welcome to my product search demo repository. 

### Setup
A few things to do before you can get started/run locally: 

 * Get a Walmart Open API key. (Try here: https://developer.walmartlabs.com/page)
 * `npm install`: This will install the dependencies.
 * Setup an `app-settings` file for API key - this keeps the API key out of the repo.
    * Create a file called `app-settings` in the root directory
    * Put the following into the file: `export APIKEY="kjybrqfdgp3u4yv2qzcnjndj"`
    * Bring the file into your dev environment. In a terminal, type:  `source app-settings`
 
### Running
You should be able to run the application with the command `npm start`.
